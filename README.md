# Prototype-German-Game-VR
An alpha-level prototype VR game to teach glass recycling and waste management systems in German public spaces. The VR game is a port of a [3D version](https://doktorfrag.com/2011/04/20/download-game-prototype) developed in 2011 and will serve as a foundation for future versions of the game in French, German, and Spanish. User interaction data is tracked and exported for assessment purposes as CSV files in project Data folder:

* Collected bottles: What type of bottle (green, brown, or clear glass), where it appeared, when the user picked it up, and when the user disposed of it.
* HMD data: time, coordinate-x, coorindate-y, coordinate-z, euler-x, euler-y, euler-z

You can view a walkthrough video of the game [here](https://youtu.be/vS3ewZjT5ds).
